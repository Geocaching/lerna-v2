# Changes Made to ObjectDetails Component

## Issue: Use `pre` elements to preserve the whitespacing of the level

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Modified the content container in `ObjectDetails` component:**
   - Replaced the `<div>` element with a `<pre>` element to preserve whitespace
   - Added the `whitespace-pre-wrap` class to ensure text still wraps properly
   - Removed the inline style that was using `paddingLeft` for indentation

2. **Implemented explicit whitespace indentation:**
   - Added explicit whitespace using `{' '.repeat(level * 2)}` before each line
   - Applied this whitespace to all relevant elements within the component:
     - Property key-value pairs
     - "More items" message
     - Closing bracket

3. **Updated tests:**
   - Modified the test that checks for the content container to look for a `pre` element instead of a `div`

### Benefits:

- Improved rendering of nested structures with proper indentation
- Better preservation of whitespace in the displayed object structure
- More semantic HTML by using the appropriate `<pre>` element for preformatted text

These changes ensure that the whitespace of each level is properly preserved, making the displayed object structure more readable and accurately representing the nesting levels.

## Issue: Fix nested objects display format

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Modified the `ValueRenderer` component:**
   - Added `className="inline-block"` to the nested `ObjectDetails` component
   - Wrapped the nested `ObjectDetails` component in a `<span className="inline">` element to ensure inline display

2. **Updated the summary element in `ObjectDetails` component:**
   - Modified the format to display the title, colon, and opening bracket on the same line
   - Changed from `{displayTitle} {Array.isArray(data) ? `(${data.length})` : ''} {openBracket}` to `{displayTitle}{Array.isArray(data) ? `(${data.length})` : ''}: {openBracket}`

3. **Updated tests:**
   - Fixed the test that was looking for `details > div > div.py-1` to look for `details > pre > div.py-1` to reflect the new component structure

### Benefits:

- Fixed the formatting issue where nested objects were being displayed with the collapse/expand indicator and object name on separate lines
- Improved readability of nested objects by ensuring consistent formatting
- Maintained compatibility with existing tests

These changes ensure that nested objects are displayed in a more compact and readable format, with the collapse/expand indicator, object name, and opening bracket all on the same line.

## Issue: Fix property name duplication in nested objects

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Modified the `ValueRenderer` component:**
   - Removed the use of `keyName` when setting the title for nested objects
   - Changed from `const title = keyName ? keyName : isArray ? 'Array' : value.constructor.name || 'Object'` to `const title = isArray ? 'Array' : value.constructor.name || 'Object'`
   - Added a comment explaining the change: `// Don't use keyName for title to avoid duplication`

### Benefits:

- Fixed the issue where property names were being displayed twice in nested objects
- Improved readability by eliminating redundant information
- Maintained the correct object type information in the display

This change ensures that property names only appear once in the output, making the object structure cleaner and easier to read.

## Issue: Move [+]/[-] indicators to the left of property names

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Created a new `PropertyItem` component:**
   - Implemented a dedicated component for rendering individual properties
   - Added individual toggle state for each property with nested objects
   - Positioned [+]/[-] indicators to the left of property names instead of type names

2. **Restructured the `ObjectDetails` component:**
   - Removed the `details` and `summary` elements in favor of regular `div` elements
   - Used the new `PropertyItem` component to render each property
   - Simplified the main component to focus on container styling and property iteration

3. **Updated the `ValueRenderer` component:**
   - Simplified to only handle primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.)
   - Removed handling of nested objects since that's now done by `PropertyItem`
   - Added display of type information inline with property names

4. **Improved indentation and alignment:**
   - Ensured all children are aligned to the right of [+]/[-] indicators
   - Maintained consistent indentation across all nesting levels
   - Preserved whitespace using the existing `pre` element approach

5. **Updated tests:**
   - Modified tests to match the new component structure
   - Updated selectors to look for `div` elements instead of `details` and `summary`
   - Adjusted expectations for text content to match the new format

### Benefits:

- Improved visual hierarchy with [+]/[-] indicators directly next to the properties they control
- Better alignment of nested content, making the structure easier to understand
- More intuitive collapsing/expanding behavior with indicators next to property names
- Type information displayed inline with property names for better context
- Individual toggle state for each property, allowing more granular control

These changes create a more intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploring nested objects, with clearer visual cues about the structure and relationships between properties.
